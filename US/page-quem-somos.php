                    <p>
                        Traditionally, the container used to serve yerba mate is guampa, made ​​from part of a cow horn, with one end sealed with wood. 
                        Also uses an aluminum bowl that besides maintaining the temperature of the water con,. is practical and hygienic as well as the glass cup. 
                        The pump is used to filter the infusion of yerba mate that does not absorb the dust of crushed herb. These are typically made of aluminum, and should never be made ​​of iron because of the oxidation that alters the flavor of the infusion. You can also find made ​​of gold, silver, alpaca and stainless steel.

                        Both the pump and the glass may have props with pictures of the symbols, initials or family name gemstones.

                        <h2>AS PRODUCES AND SELLS A MATE WITH HERB TERERÉ® TRADEMARK OF 'A' A 'Z' </h2>
                        <h3>1 - Crop transport and reception of Yerba Mate </h3><br />
                        It is noteworthy that yerba mate is planted, providing numerous benefits to the end consumer. <br />
                        The management done by skilled staff is the guarantee of a herbal conducted with pre-determined deadlines for harvest. The organic fertilizer is a property that adds this raw material making a line of top quality, as the flavors and nutrients. 
                        The harvested parts are placed on a canvas, which prevents its contact with the ground and therefore perhaps with microorganisms that may contaminate the leaves. 
                        During transport, a canvas of restraint required to avoid people traveling on the burdens of yerba mate, to prevent personnel with the material or any impurities that may settle on the leaves touch ensuring proper hygiene in the process. 

                        <h3>2 - Thermal Shock - Dehydration.</h3><br />
                        And the process in which the sheets are given a heat shock by means of direct flame,
                        while the occurs oxidative inactivation of enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, 
                        which makes the sheets blackened. In this process, besides the pre-drying, the initial fractionation of yerba mate occurs.
                        This process must be initiated no more than 24 hours after harvest, because the leaf, following the removal of the plant,
                        continues to consume oxygen and sugar.<br />
                        The dehydration process of mate - carried to the machine for mats - is caused by that passage, 
                        along the cylinder (diameter of 1.8m to 2.4m and length of 6m to 9m) made with sheet metal or screen, 
                        allowing the leaves to be hit by flames or heat generated in the furnace.<br />
                        Yerba mate has great ability to acquire the odors of the woods used in dehydration. 
                        And the critical point for the good quality of the grass, for adequate heat depends 
                        on the quality of the wood used, apart from the aspects of intensity and duration controlled by the operator drying. 
                        Improper drying can lead to low quality products resulting from improper combustion. 
                        A good drying is the critical factor for the quality and hygiene of Yerba Mate. 

                        <h3>3 - Drying</h3><br />
                        The drying process is one whereby the heat, remove the remaining moisture from the product, obtaining the crushed and dried yerba mate, 
                        which is called yerba mate cancheada. During this process, the mate sheet undergoes dehydration which causes a weight loss of about 60% as 
                        it passes through a temperature which can reach 300°C for 5 minutes resulting in 
                        the destruction of foreign organisms and destruction of molecules water. 
                        Typically, prior to drying in rotary dryers, the material undergoes fragmentation, for example drying is rapid, 
                        large size if they are not dried properly materials. Therefore, after drying, the stems are separated and undergo a further step of drying. 
                        Generally in rotary dryers, the drying time is 5 minutes sheets, while the stems was approximately 15 minutes. 

                        <h3>4 - Grinding</h3><br />
                        Milling, also called fragmentation was formerly held in a container called cancha timber and a 
                        tapered wood chipper with multiple teeth revolved inside the container, which is secured to a vertical axis, grinding it. Other forms of fragmentation of mate were used, 
                        the most cited using machetes wooden pestle, the water mill and the punch. 
                        There are the most modern and efficient metal processors today. 

                        <h3>5 - Standardization</h3><br />
                        In this step are separated stems and leaves of different sizes. 
                        Dry yerba mate is separated by sizes of leaves and stems, and another machine does the mixture of some of these sizes to give a product that has the maximum quality and flavor. 

                        <h3>6 - Bottling</h3><br />
                        The yerba mate is mixed in percentages in various sizes and longer drought goes through various machines which achieves the optimal dosage 
                        For the quality of desired flavors, after achieving a level of excellence to the raw mate ilex paraguariensis, 
                        shall be reserved in silos feeders that give rise to different products in the line Tereré and teas. 
                        Performed after standardization and dosage, these combinations are conducted until the final packaging machines generating Tereré. 
                        The raw materials that compose the range of teas is elevated to a roaster to be toasted, to obtain the desired standards of quality, 
                        and then transported to silos where they subsequently feed the packers resulting in the product ready for consumption.
